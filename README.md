The pressure sensor is to detect the weight of the trays and plates outside the hotel room and it will inform the management to send for a cleaner to clear the trays and plates. This is to prevent a smell coming from the plates when it is outside for a very long time. 

The touch sensor and the display board will be placed in every hotel room. The sensor will be placed at a certain height to prevent kids from touching the sensor. After the sensor is tapped, the display will show, " Sending for housekeeping service in 30 minutes time" because the hotel guests only wants housekeeping when they are not inside the hotel room. After the housekeeper has finished housekeeping the hotel room, the housekeeper need to tap the touch sensor for the second time to inform the management that the hotel room has cleaned. This will prevent theft cases.
